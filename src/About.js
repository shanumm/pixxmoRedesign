              Welcome to pixXmo. <br /> The thought that “every pixel has a
              moment” made me express my passion through a digital medium. What
              began as a medium of expression, gradually saw a transformation,
              when I met like-minded people whom I call my family now. The
              journey of one became the journey of many and the collective
              strength brought us here. I am forever grateful to all my team
              members for standing with me in this beautiful never-ending
              journey. We are committed to our art and strive to put our
              creative forces into our work. I cannot express enough gratitude
              to my parents who are and will always be a constant source of
              strength in all my endeavors. <br /> <br /> NISHANT TIWARI <br />{" "}
